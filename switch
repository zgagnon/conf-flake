# A quick script to speed up switching to a new darwin generation on some Mac machines

# Kandji (a tool used by MO) likes to edit this and break nix control. I don't care about the kandji thing,
# so just delete it before we start.

rm ~/.ssh/config



# Switch to the new generation.


darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/darwin-flake/ --fallback



# After the update, we need to source our .zshrc in this session, so place the source line in the paste buffer


echo "source ~/.zshrc" | pbcopy
